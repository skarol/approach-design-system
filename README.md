# Approaching Design System in iOS Environment

Does building a pixel-perfect iOS UI across all devices have to be annoying? 

This repository contains my presentation _Approaching Design System in iOS Environment_ from [plSwift](https://plswift.com) conference in 2022.

Presentation was made using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

## Source code

The source code of the example used in this presentation is published [here](https://github.com/skarol/plSwiftShowcase).

You can also take a look on [DesignSystemUtils](https://github.com/skarol/DesignSystemUtils) package, as it contains example helpers and basic types to help you get started with building a Design System for your own.
